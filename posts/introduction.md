### A simple static blog generator, using markdown

# What is jsBlog?
jsBlog is a tool that makes it easy to create blogs on static websites, such as GitHub pages.
Static websites are usually free, since they offer no server site processing, which can make it difficult to produce changing content, such as a blog.
Using this tool, you will be able to include images, links and code snippets among other things, with more on the way.
This tool is also free to use and modify to your heart's content. A mention or a link back to here would be much appreciated though.

# What is this not?
This tool isn't a full blogging framework. Due to the nature of static websites, login and comment systems aren't possible.
At the moment to modify or add a post it is required that the user open the files and directly edit the contents themselves (more details on that later), an interface to generate the markdown is in the works, hold tight!

# What's next?
Go back to the menu (the `x` in the top right corner), and look at other posts to learn about the syntax, customisation options, and how to make your own posts.
